        <p>Hi, I'm Jasmin. Currently I am studying Content Strategy in Graz at FH JOANNEUM. This is also the place that plays a huge role in my life since 2019 as I have studied there journalism and PR and worked there several times. Right now I am part of the PR and marketing section of the university of applied sciences. Additionally to that I am also responsible for the social media channels of the institute of automtovie engineering. If there is any time left for my private life I like to bake, cook and eat.</p>
